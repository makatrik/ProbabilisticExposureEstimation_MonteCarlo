# ProbabilisticExposureEstimation_MonteCarlo
A custom-made R script was developed to estimate probabilistic oral human exposure using Monte Carlo simulations. The code has broad applicability for any chemical. To estimate exposure you need to combine consumption data from biomonitoring studies or/and databases and occurrence data of the chemical of various food items that has been consumed and can be found in literature. This code was used to estimate probabilistc human exposure to mycotoxins and has been submitted for publication,
