# ProbabilisticExposureEstimation_MonteCarlo
Probabilistic exposure estimates, using Monte Carlo Simulations
A custom-made R script wass developed to estimate probabilistic oral exposure using Monte Carlo simulations. To estimate exposure you need to 
 combine consumption data from biomonitoring studies or/and databases and occurrence data of various food items that can be found in literature.
