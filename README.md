# ProbabilisticExposureEstimation_MonteCarlo
A custom-made R script wass developed to estimate probabilistic oral exposure using Monte Carlo simulations. To estimate exposure you need to 
 combine consumption data from biomonitoring studies or/and databases and occurrence data of various food items that can be found in literature. This code was used to estimate probabilistc exposure to Mycotoxins in the paper 
 'Exploring the Relationship between Daily Intake and Renal Excretion of the Mycotoxins T-2 and HT-2 Toxin in Humans
